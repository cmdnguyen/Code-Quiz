## Description

This is a simple quiz using JavaScript. It uses HTML and CSS, but most of the elements are created through JavaScript. It was definitely a challenging task considering I am a beginner. 

Despite the amount of hair-pulling moments over why my questions are not advancing, I definitely learned to always check the spelling of the code and check the scopes of my functions for variables within.
